**TTAGIT** is a Twitter tool that allows users to use [Twitter](https://twitter.com) as a bullboard on any URL.

The TTAGIT extension works with `Chrome`, `Firefox`, `Safari`, `Internet Explorer` and `IOS devices`. Open the extension with your browser over any URL and interact with the Tweets relevant to that URL.

* TTAGIT also has an embed so you can embed TTAGIT on your own website.

* Whether you use it as Analytics tool to see what people are Tweeting about the URL or as a useful commenting system TTAGIT gives you the edge, and takes Twitter to new realms.

### existing systems

The majority of extensions made are just the same version of an application put into an extension, at TTAGIT we wanted to make an extension that actually extended the capabilities of an application.

With all commenting systems they only begin when the system is installed on the website, whereas with TTAGIT it compiles all relevant tweets onto one feed.

### TTAGIT's edge

TTAGIT allows users to **like**, **reply** or **retweet** so they can interact as if they were actually on Twitter.

<div class="message">
With the embed feature TTAGIT can be added to any website and used as the sites commenting system, which will also show all the Twitter interaction using that link.
</div>

TTAGIT's action extension on `IOS mobile devices` lets users interact with relevant tweets like a bookmarking tool. And TTAGIT's browser extensions let users immediately see what is being tweeted on any URL without having to go to your Twitter account.
