With a growing global population the need for more Niche markets grows every day. Mainstream just doesn't cut it anymore, it's impossible to please all 7 billion people with Monopolies.

This is one of the reasons there is so much resistance to Globalism today, a Global system would never work, there's far too many people and far too many diversities that would clash in such a system.

Applications like **Facebook**, **Twitter** and **Youtube** wrestle with differing opinions, and seem to have biased censorship that shows that their mainstream is politically one sided, and definitely financially one sided.

One by one as these applications get more popular they lose their freedom of speech, most likely due to law suits pending against them. It seems freedoms are more available when the applications are in early adopters hands.

This definitely shows a Niche need for growing freedom of speech applications to replace old models like Facebook, Twitter and Google products.

### Some Niche ideas

1. A store for Web Language applications to replace the **Play** store and the **Apple** store. The benefit is making the application once.
2. More search engines, ones that search Darknet for content that Google deems Fake News or unpopular opinion.
3. Another Internet completely. Perhaps Darknet needs to completely leave the existing Internet and start its own, this way it could protect privacy through encryption.
4. Commenting stems that lie on top of the webpage through browser extensions. I've built one model already that I've used **IOS** action extension capabilities to use **Twitter** over any webpage. [ttagit.com](http://ttagit.com)

The fact that these applications don't cut it for everyone anymore means plenty of opportunities for startups to fill the void. There's plenty of untapped users out there just waiting to use something that is more geared to them.

### Niche Markets off the Internet

It's not just on the Internet that Niche Markets need to be filled but off the Internet in Business as well. Mainstream media doesn't cut it for many, it seems too biased in one agenda to deliver what everyone wants to hear.

Alternative media is growing because it can deliver a specific message to its target audience rather than spoiling the news while trying to remain Politically correct.

There's Niches in:

* Entertainment
* Food and Beverage
* Sports
* Hotels
* Holiday packages
* Architecture
* Landscaping

### Political Niche

Even in Politics we are seeing the need for Niches to be filled, the Globalist dream would be impossible, imagine if Trump got in as World President, there'd be riots. Even in the US it is looking like it needs a split in Politics from the Right and the Left.

It may be in California's best interest to separate, as some states may want more autonomy from each other.

In Syria we see the same, a need for autonomy with the Kurds, Assyrians, non Secular Sunnis and the Ba'ath Government supporters. Autonomy is it's own Niche, and Partition may be the answer, not just for Syria but the US and parts of Europe.

There are some people who want Nationalism while others want a more diverse political spectrum, there's no reason both parties can't get what they want, compromise with Niches and we can come to peaceful solutions.

The world is always changing, and we must always change with the world, seek solutions not conflict.
