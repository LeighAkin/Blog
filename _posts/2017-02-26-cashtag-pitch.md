**Cashtag** is a Mobile extension tool that lets users connect to trading applications and bring up trades relevant to the article they open the extension on.

For example if a user is reading a [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com) article and it mentions a company or trading symbol the user is interested in then the user can open the extension and it will scrape the article looking for company information and bring up the relevant trades so the user can start trading immediately.

* Cashtag is powered by the patented TTAGIT technology platform.

* Cashtag lets you trade overtop of the article you are reading without leaving the page.

* Cashtag can identify company names and currency symbols on any page and prepare your trade from the page you are reading.

* Cashtag also brings up relevant mentions across social channels relating to the article you are reading.

## TTAGIT baked right in

Cashtag uses [http://ttagit.com/](http://ttagit.com/) as its bullboard tool.

**TTAGIT** is a [Twitter](https://twitter.com) tool that allows users to use Twitter as a bullboard on any URL. The TTAGIT extension works with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and IOS devices.

TTAGIT compiles all Tweets relative to the URL together on one feed that users can interact with. TTAGIT allows users to like, reply or retweet so they can interact as if they were actually on Twitter.

Using TTAGIT with Cashtag gives users the ability to look at feedback about an article or a potential trade.

Cashtag also brings up recent news releases so users can look at the latest news from companies they potentially want to invest in.

## Sentiment Analysis

Cashtag uses **Sentiment Analysis** to grade the interest in the company and article the user is interacting with.

Sentiment Analysis determines whether a piece of writing is `positive`, `negative` or `neutral`. A common use case for this technology is to discover how people feel about a particular topic.

It's also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. A common use case for this technology is to discover how people **feel about a particular topic**.

### Usability

Cashtag is basically like a [http://www.stockhouse.com/](http://www.stockhouse.com/) in an extension tool, that gives you insight immediately from articles involving potential trading investments.

* Switching views is a pain when trading and surfing the Internet.

* Making trades while reading an article online involves changing tabs or even going to applications which distracts from the content of the page you have been focused on reading.

<div class="message">
And from the time you read a breaking news story to placing your trade, you may have missed the early profit entry. Time is money!

### Development

Cashtag is at the final stage of development, we are looking for a default trading API to connect with to allow Cashtag to start trading.

We would like to use the API for [https://www.robinhood.com/](https://www.robinhood.com/) which is a free trading application. As Cashtag progresses more trading options will be added.

We hope to be launching Cashtag soon, but until then you can find out more at [http://cashtag.io/](http://cashtag.io/).
