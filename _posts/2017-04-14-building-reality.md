There's something to be said about reality, that virtual reality will always remain just that, virtual. The movie passengers did a good job of pointing out that AI no matter how good will leave you lonely, depressed and suicidal.

In a real community everyone is held accountable and can make noticeable contributions, whereas in an online community you are only accountable to your reputation online, and may even be anonymous or using a nickname.

### Points on weaknesses in AI

1. One dimensional
2. Lacking Semantics
3. Fails the Turing Test
4. Not believable

AI and Sentiment Analysis may be the rage, but at the moment both suck. Sentiment Analysis is weak usually in the delivery of UI/UX, though also the uselessness of the data makes it weak.

### Physical reality

The Applications which seem to be leading have physical outcomes, like **Car2Go**, **Uber**, **AirBnB**. If people see a physical outcome they feel more connected to reality. So it's not virtual reality that is the near future, it's enhanced reality, virtual reality has a long way to go, and the journey is through enhanced reality, games like `Pokemon Go` are a start.

In the Application direction, myself, I'd move in the direction of Enhanced Reality (ER).
