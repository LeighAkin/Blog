Beyond the mass data bank of completely obnoxious quotes that Donald Trump has made I think his worst actions are that he has completely pulled a 180 on everything he said his campaign was about. Trump went from American Nationalist to American traitor.

After all this talk about being America First and a champion against Globalism he caves into the Globalist narrative and policing the world which he said was Obama's mistake.

<div class="message">Trump: 'I'm A Nationalist And A Globalist. I'm Both.'

We always knew Trump would bend over backwards to Israel, but it seemed he fought against the globalist powers in the US, but after a barrage of attacks from the Media he seems to have given in to both sides of the same coin. No more America first, he's a Nationalist for Israel and a Globalist for Corporate America.
