The price one pays for a successful blog, chat system or social network is censorship. I would assume due to fame, and pressure from investors, shareholders, users and legal pressure. When you're peanuts nobody cares, your audience is small and you aren't on the radar.

Success equals censorship. Does this mean the less you have and the less you are known the freer you are? Buddha would think so. Buddha was about erasing the ego.

> No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path.
â€• Gautama Buddha, Sayings Of Buddha

### The Inevitable Mad Scientist

Inevitably as attention is drawn to success a Frankenstein monster is created, which everyone tries to control or be a part of.

Best case example is what is happening at Twitter right now, the combination of an IPO and lacking any obvious monetization strategies with massive political pressure from the left has made Twitter a machination for Main Stream Media and political correctness.

Twitter went into a purge mode of accounts when the Alt Right gained popularity on the platform. Twitter sent a message to its followers that it would only accept opinions for a Liberal audience, shutting down edgy conservative viewpoints.
