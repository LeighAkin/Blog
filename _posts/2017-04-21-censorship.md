The price one pays for a successful blog, chat system or social network is censorship. I would assume due to fame, and pressure from investors, shareholders, users and legal pressure. When you're peanuts nobody cares, your audience is small and you aren't on the radar.

Success equals censorship. Does this mean the less you have and the less you are known the freer you are? Buddha would think so. Buddha was about erasing the ego.

> No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path.
â€• Gautama Buddha, Sayings Of Buddha

### The Inevitable Mad Scientist

Inevitably as attention is drawn to success it becomes a Frankenstein monster, which everyone tries to control or be a part of.

Best case example is what is happening at Twitter right now, the combination of an IPO and lacking any obvious monetization strategies with massive political pressure from the left has made Twitter a machination for Main Stream Media and political correctness.

Twitter went into a purge mode of accounts when the Alt Right gained popularity on the platform. Twitter sent a message to its followers that it would only accept opinions for a `Liberal audience`, shutting down edgy conservative viewpoints.

## Top 5 things that suck with Twitter right now

1. The suspicious activity warning that wants your phone number. Sometimes even demanding a voice call verification.
2. Shadow banning. This is where your followers can see your tweets but your tweets are taken off search. At times tweets are even removed from the tree of tweets.
3. Suspensions without reasons, being left in the dark as to why exactly the account was suspended.
4. Phone number blocking. Twitter has banned phone numbers from making accounts.
5. Biased reporting. Racism is allowed at levels, and even fully against one race but not others, and especially not against affluent minorities in the United States.

This of course is not the intention of the creators, it is the monster that is created from paranoid investors and their advisors. Not to mention pressure from groups like the **ADL**, **SPLC**, **CAIR** and their legal teams. Twitter would buckle eventually.

Of course all the majors are locked into the same phenomena, Twitter is no exception.

And the worst is yet to come, as the USA has handed control of the Internet over to the UN.
