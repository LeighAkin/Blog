Choosing a date can be tiresome if for the first time you just want to meet one another and feel each other out. Why not go for beers?

**Go4Beers** makes choosing a date simple, you sift through profiles you like, say yay or nay, and if you get a match choose a bar to meet at that is between both your locations, you can also check specials and promotions on the application if bars have posted any.

Go4Beers isn't a dating application, it's a `pre dating` application

### Why dating sucks

1. It’s Expensive
2. You Can Never Be Yourself
3. It’s Tiring
4. Rejection Seriously Sucks

With go4beers there's no strings attached, meet someone for drinks and see where it goes, maybe you just found a new drinking buddy.

> You can't be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline - it helps if you have some kind of football team, or some nuclear weapons, but in the very least you need a beer. ~ Frank Zappa
