If anyone has been on a commenting section or discussion on any social network around the **Israel/Palestine** subject then most likely you have experienced the Israel Trolls. If you haven't then this post is for you.

Israel trolls try and shame critics of Israel, and if that doesn't work they try and engage in hostile debate until they can push someone to say something they can report and possible suspend users, they are like that little brother that starts trouble and then tattles.

Even a neutral opinion such as supporting a two state solution will send the Israel trolls into a tailspin of insults and accusations of anti semitism directed toward the two state supporters. This isn't guarding Israel or Jews, this is Jewish supremacism in the Levant.

### Who are these Israel Trolls?

The Israel trolls are a number of things.

* Israelis (Obviously)
* Zionist Christians
* Neo conservative
* Anti Muslims

Israel trolls have an agenda, which is to erase Palestine in history and geography. They will deny the occupation and the illegal settlements, claiming that Israel is all of Palestine, and Arabs have no right to the land.

The Israel Trolls gang up on critics and cyber bully them into either abandoning their position, shamed into being demonized or their accounts are suspended.

<div class="message">Mossad's former motto, be-tachbūlōt ta'aseh lekhā milchāmāh (Hebrew: בתחבולות תעשה לך מלחמה‎) is a quote from the Bible (Proverbs 24:6): "For by wise guidance you can wage your war" (NRSV)</div>

The Israel trolls have a pre written propaganda that they all use and share amongst each other like a mantra. Some of the trolls are even college students paid by pro Israel groups. The Jewish Internet Defense Force [(JIDF)](http://www.thejidf.org/) makes a job out of harassing critics of Israel's foreign policies.

### The hypocrisy of Israel's morality

Israel seems to do what everyone condemns Trump of trying to do. Israel has a wall, Israel has a strict immigration policy that at times requires a DNA test to prove you are Jewish. Israel has poor relations with its neighbours, Israel has admitted to giving Ethiopian migrants birth control without them knowing it to curb the population of Ethiopian population in Israel.

Israel has a very Nationalistic quality to it while Jews in Europe and the USA have a history of leading anti Nationalist civic rights movements. The Jewish organizations in Europe and America seem to have one opinion for Israel and the other for Europe and the USA.

This type of double speak is aggravating to anyone that either opposes Israel's policies for the Palestinians and Nationalists in European and American countries.
