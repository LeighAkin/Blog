**Phatpen** is a Mobile extension tool that lets users connect to trading applications and bring up trades relevant to the article they open the extension on. For example if a user is reading a Bloomberg article and it mentions a company or trading symbol the user is interested in then the user can open the extension and it will scrape the article looking for company information and bring up the relevant trades so the user can start trading immediately.

Phatpen is at the final stage of development, we are looking for a default trading API to connect with to allow Phatpen to start trading. We would like to use the API for [https://www.robinhood.com/](https://www.robinhood.com/) which is a free trading application. As Phatpen progresses more trading options will be added.

Phatpen uses [http://ttagit.com/](http://ttagit.com/) as its bullboard tool. TTAGIT is a Twitter tool that allows users to use Twitter as a bullboard on any URL. The TTAGIT extension works with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and IOS devices. TTAGIT compiles all Tweets relative to the URL together on one feed that users can interact with. TTAGIT allows users to like, reply or retweet so they can interact as if they were actually on Twitter. Using TTAGIT with Phatpen gives users the ability to look at feedback about an article or a potential trade.

Phatpen also brings up recent news releases so users can look at the latest news from companies they potentially want to invest in.

Phatpen uses Sentiment Analysis to grade the interest in the company and article the user is interacting with. **Sentiment Analysis** is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It's also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. A common use case for this technology is to discover how people feel about a particular topic.

Phaten is basically like a [http://www.stockhouse.com/](http://www.stockhouse.com/) in an extension tool, that gives you insight immediately from articles involving potential trading investments.

We hope to be launching Phatpen soon, but until then you can find out more at [http://phatpen.com/](http://phatpen.com/).
